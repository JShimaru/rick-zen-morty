SUMMARY:
Take a moment to reflect on life and maybe laugh
a bit too. Rick Zen Morty combines thoughtful 
quotes with a random character from the show 
many know and I personally love. This is a 
result of my Per Scholas studies on React.When
you arrive to the page you are greeted to a 
classic Rick tagline followed with a request for
a number between 1 and 5. Upon your entry you 
are immediately reward with your quotes. Enjoy!

MVP/POST MVP:
The current version {MVP} generates 5 "Cards"
consisting of a Rick and Morty Character and
image and a quote beneath the image. Eventually
I'd like to style the cards some more so 
it's more appealing. Perhaps add a daily quote
and guess the author of the quote.
