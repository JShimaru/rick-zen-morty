                <p>When faced with the challenge of creating an original(ish) website in a week or so I immediately felt the need to find my Plumbus. What else can a simple Rick like myself do to find a way to create something worth sharing that truly encompasses me as myself.</p>
            <h5>Thank goodness for Rick Zen Morty</h5>
                <p>When all seemed lost and no project would be completed, what helped me keep my calm and create a functional zen generator for the masses to consumer at their leisure (CAPITALISM!!!). Of course the answer is clear.</p>
